## About

This repository is a compilation of my solutions to DSA problems. I aim to provide clear, efficient, and optimized implementations along with explanations of the underlying algorithms and approaches used.

## Folder Structure

- `Problem_Name`: Each DSA problem is organized into its folder.
  - `problemName.py`: Python file containing the solution code.
  - `README.md`: Explanation of the problem statement, approach, and algorithm used.

## Solutions

You can find solutions to various DSA problems in this repository. Each problem folder contains:

- Problem description and constraints.
- Python code implementing the solution.

## Contributing
